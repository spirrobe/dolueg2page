        Precipiation is measured by collectors with defined and standardised collection area. Take note that our collectors are usually not heated during winter with the exception of Basel-Klingelbergstrasse. Thus, snowfall is not measured instantly but rather with a delay for melting. Hence, there may appear false precipitation, which should be associated with an earlier event.
