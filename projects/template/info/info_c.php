        The mean wind velocity and wind gust are measured by classical cup anemometers. At the station Lange Erlen and at the top of Basel-Klingelbergstrasse there are also wind vane and propeller comininations installed. Some stations vary in the height where the wind is measured, see details in the figures. The different surroundings and surface roughnesses do impact turbulence measurements and the wind profile to different extents. Turbulence is measured at Basel Aeschenplatz and Basel Klingelbergstrasse by means of sonic anemometers in addition to optional other wind measurements.

    The wind direction usually is detected by wind vanes, often (as mentioned above) a combination of cup or propeller is often in place as well. For the so detected mean wind direction the local topography has major impact. Such an effect can be seen at the station Lange Erlen: The axis of the valley in NE-SW direction modifies the primary wind direction.
