"Lange Erlen" is 7 km outside of the city center of Basel, located between L&ouml;rrach, Riehen and Weil am Rhein in a recreational area of the same name.
The proximity of the station surroundings is being used as aggricultural grassland as the terrain is flat. The station is located at the exit of the valley of the Wiese towards the upper rhine valley and thus allows study of valley associated wind systems.
This can be seen by the strong influence of down valley winds at night from the direction of north-east during approximatively 50% of the time.

<p>The station serves as a rural, or at least suburban station, where profiles of air temperature, humidity, wind velocity as well as wind direction are measured at the tower with 10 m height.
Furthermore, radiationbalance and soil temperature measurement are conducted here.
