        Status variables are mainly a control instrument: Battery voltage and logger case temperature allow to check instantly whether problems might occur at stations with solar power. Indirectly, the battery voltage shows sunshine hours, i.e. time with enough radiation when the station is solar powered. Furthermore, the case temperature allows for a quick estimation whether measured temperature values are in the right ballpark.
