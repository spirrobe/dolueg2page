	<h3>Navigation</h3>
        <p>Dolueg2 is structured on the main level by (more or less) geographical distinct campaigns. Under each campaign you will find the single stations associated with the campaign and the time series we have selected. If you click on the campaign in the top menu, you will get a selection of overview graphics, often including maps of the stations under information.
	For this overview and the single stations the figures may be shown for a specific station of for specific variable (e.g. temperature and humidity). For each station a map showing the wind field and location is included again under information. Such wind fields and corresponding maps are separated into wind during night and day as indicated by the colors. Further, the newest wind vector at the time of creation is indicated with an orange arrow. If no wind is measured, just the location may be indicated</p>

        <h3>Dolueg2</h3>
        <p>Contrary to the previous version, figures are created as SVGs (scalable vector graphics). As the name indicates, these are vectors graphs instead of typical raster images and are thus scalable. To keep the layout somewhat consistent, for the zoom/scale functionality you will have to drag the figures to a new/other browser tab.
	If you are interest in a specific figure, simply right-click on it and a "Save as ..." dialog should open. If you need another format than SVG (looking at you Microsoft users), you may convert them with other programs such as Corel Draw, Adobe Illustrator or Inkscape.</p>

        <h3>Special campaigns</h3>
        <p>The menu entry "Control" is to allow another quick internal view of the data flow and whether errors may have occurred.</p>

	<h3>Hint for external users</h3>
	<p>Since we are mainly concerned with research, we do not guarantee or assume any liability for the quality or even actuality of any figures.</p>
